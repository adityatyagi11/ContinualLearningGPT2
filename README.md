Continual Learning GPT-2 with Memory Bank
This project implements a continual learning system for GPT-2 that maintains a dynamic external memory. The memory is updated based on loss improvement after encoding a new fact, and it is later retrieved and softly fused back into the model to improve generation.

Overview
This system wraps a frozen GPT-2 model with an external differentiable memory bank. It:

Learns from new examples if they improve prediction (lower loss),

Stores them as memory vectors (with category, importance, etc.),

Retrieves relevant memories during inference using a query-based attention mechanism,

Infuses retrieved memories back into the hidden states before generation, enhancing context awareness.

Key Components
‚úÖ MemoryBank
A custom module that:

Stores vector representations of past examples (up to memory_size),

Checks for semantic duplicates using cosine similarity (with a strict threshold, e.g., 0.99),

Scores each memory by importance (based on how much the example reduced loss),

Supports retrieve_memories() using a weighted similarity + importance score.

‚úÖ ContinualLearningGPT2
A custom GPT-2 wrapper that:

Learns from examples using .learn_from_example(text, category)

Extracts content representations using position-weighted average from hidden states

Encodes memories using a feedforward memory encoder + category noise

Stores memory only if it provides loss-based improvement

Uses a SimpleMemoryAttention module to inject memory vectors during generation

‚úÖ SimpleMemoryAttention
A lightweight attention mechanism that:

Projects hidden state ‚Üí memory query

Retrieves top-k memories from MemoryBank

Gently infuses a soft gated memory vector into the last few tokens

Ensures minimal interference (gating with very small weights like 0.05)

How It Learns
During training:

Tokenizes the example and gets the model's baseline loss (use_memory=False)

Computes a vector (memory_repr) from hidden states

Adds slight category-based noise to diversify representations

Calculates an importance score: improvement = base_loss * category_multiplier

Checks for semantic/textual duplicates

If it‚Äôs a new and useful memory (loss improvement > threshold), it is stored.

How It Retrieves
At generation time:

Takes the last token‚Äôs hidden state as the query

Computes cosine similarity with stored memory keys

Selects top-k matches, scores them with a blend of similarity and importance

Fuses a weighted average of these vectors into the hidden states via a gating layer

How It Is Used in Generation
Input ‚Üí Tokenized ‚Üí Hidden states computed via GPT-2

Query ‚Üí Memory vectors retrieved based on current context

Final hidden states ‚Üí Memory-enhanced ‚Üí Used to produce next tokens

Repeat for each generation step

Output Summary
Here‚Äôs a sample from the system output:

Memory Stored:


[0] geography: Paris is the capital city of France....
[1] programming: Python is a programming language used for AI....
[2] astronomy: The Earth orbits around the Sun....
[3] physics: Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius....
[4] literature: Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet....
[5] science: Einstein developed the theory of relativity....
Prompt ‚Üí Generated:

Prompt: 'Einstein's theory'
Generated: 'Einstein's theory of relativity. However, we can also learn about Einstein's theory of relativity'
Retrieved Memories for Query:

  Memory 0: Score=1.432, Text='Einstein developed the theory of relativity....'
  Memory 1: Score=1.381, Text='The Earth orbits around the Sun....'
  Memory 2: Score=1.368, Text='Paris is the capital city of France....'
‚úÖ Why This Is a Strong Proof-of-Concept
This system shows that:

A frozen GPT-2 can be enhanced continually using structured external memory,

Memory additions are based on actual performance gains (loss improvement),

Retrieval is semantically relevant and contributes to better generation,

All learning is autonomous, supporting continual adaptation.

The modular design (decoupled memory encoding, gating, and retrieval) makes this system easy to scale or extend to more complex behaviors like:

Rewarded memory reinforcement,

On-device long-term persona tracking,

Episodic memory consolidation and decay.

This is an evolving research-grade prototype demonstrating how a language model can:

Learn from interaction,

Improve without backpropagation into its base weights,

Store and retrieve meaningful long-term memory.

This isn't the final thing ‚Äî it's the first working proof. And it works.
