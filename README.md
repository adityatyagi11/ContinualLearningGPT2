Memory-Augmented GPT-2 for Continual Learning

This project is a proof-of-concept continual learning system built on top of GPT-2, enhanced with a differentiable memory bank that learns new facts over time, selectively stores important representations, and injects relevant memory into future generations.

ðŸš€ Overview
Language models like GPT-2 are static after training â€” they donâ€™t evolve with new information. This repo introduces a dynamic memory system that:

Learns and stores memory vectors when new inputs reduce the model's loss.

Avoids duplicates by using vector similarity and text overlap thresholds.

Injects relevant retrieved memories into hidden states during generation using a lightweight gating mechanism.

This results in a system that augments itself without retraining the base model, while keeping memory size bounded.

ðŸ§© System Components
1. Memory Representation & Update
Each example is passed through GPT-2 and a custom content encoder.

If the example improves loss or provides new information (non-duplicate), it is encoded and added to the memory bank.

If similar memory already exists (cosine similarity > 0.99), the memory is updated rather than duplicated.

2. Memory Bank Retrieval
For any prompt, the system retrieves top-k relevant memories using a combination of cosine similarity and importance score.

It applies category bonuses to encourage balanced learning across domains.

3. Memory Injection During Generation
Retrieved memories are injected into GPT-2's final hidden layers using a gated fusion mechanism.

Only the last few tokens of the hidden state are enhanced, with small fusion weights to avoid overpowering the base model.

Generation uses this enhanced context to produce outputs that are influenced by memory.

ðŸ“Š Example Output
Training Facts:
âœ“ [geography] Learned: Paris is the capital city of France.
âœ“ [programming] Learned: Python is a programming language used for AI.
âœ“ [astronomy] Learned: The Earth orbits around the Sun.
âœ“ [physics] Learned: Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.
âœ“ [literature] Learned: Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet.
âœ“ [science] Learned: Einstein developed the theory of relativity.
Retrieval:
Query: What is the capital of France?
Retrieved:
  1. Einstein developed the theory of relativity. [score: 1.432]
  2. The Earth orbits around the Sun.            [score: 1.381]
  3. Paris is the capital city of France.        [score: 1.368]
Generation:
Prompt: "Shakespeare wrote"
Output: "Shakespeare wrote, 'The peace and tranquillity of the young...'"

Prompt: "Einstein's theory"
Output: "Einstein's theory of relativity. However, we can also learn about..."
âœ… Why This Matters
This is a working prototype that shows continual learning without model fine-tuning.

âœ… The model learns and evolves its memory representation from new inputs.

âœ… The memory directly influences generation in interpretable and non-destructive ways.

âœ… It demonstrates that loss-based gating and representation-level memory can be effective for extending LLM capabilities.

ðŸ”­ Future Improvements
This is just the beginning. Some next steps could include:

Using better backbone LLMs (GPT-J, LLaMA, Mistral) for higher base fluency.

Adding temporal decay and importance-based pruning.

Using attention-weighted memory retrieval instead of soft top-k.

Making this an on-device evolving personal assistant.

ðŸ§  Towards Self-Evolving Persona Vectors
The same memory mechanism can be adapted to:

Represent a user's behavioral and interaction style.

Continuously evolve based on long-term interactions.

Provide contextually personalized responses grounded in a self-learning memory system.

ðŸ§ª Conclusion
This project validates the core intuition that memory-enhanced generation, guided by loss-based updates, can work â€” even with a frozen GPT-2.

While the generations are far from perfect today (due to GPT-2's limits), the architecture lays the groundwork for scalable continual learning LLMs that grow over time.
